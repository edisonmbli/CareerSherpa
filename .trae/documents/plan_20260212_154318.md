I have updated the feature guide based on your feedback.

### Key Updates to Guide
1.  **Profile Auth Clarification**: Explained that `/profile` is session-secured (private dashboard) and thus naturally multi-user safe. The "Resume Share" feature fills the gap for *public* access.
2.  **Renew/Extend**: Added requirements for extending the validity period without changing the link.
3.  **UI/Design**:
    -   Explicitly required `frontend-design` skill for `ShareDialog` and `HookBanner`.
    -   Defined "Watermark/Subtle" style for the public view hook to ensure elegance.
    -   Added i18n requirements.
4.  **Analytics**: Added `referrer` and `utm_source` tracking to the event payload.

### Implementation Plan
Since you have already completed the DB migration, we can proceed directly to implementation:

1.  **Backend (DAL & Actions)**:
    -   Implement `getSharedResume` (public access via shareKey).
    -   Implement `generateShareLink` (create/update/renew).
2.  **Frontend Core**:
    -   Update `ResumeStore` and `InteractiveSection` to support `readOnly` mode.
3.  **UI Components (Frontend Design)**:
    -   Create `ShareResumeDialog` (with expiration/renew controls).
    -   Create `PublicResumeHook` (watermark style).
4.  **Page Integration**:
    -   Build `/r/[shareKey]` page with analytics tracking.

Shall we start with the **Backend** implementation first?
